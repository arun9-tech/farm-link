/* === CODE TO PREVENT SCROLLING AND FIT THE SCREEN === */

/* 
  1. Set the root HTML and BODY elements to take up 100% of the screen height.
     This creates the foundation for a full-height app.
*/

  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;

  overflow-y: hidden; /* This is the key: It hides the main vertical scrollbar of the browser window. */
  background-color: #f8f9fa; /* A standard light grey Bootstrap background color. */
}

/* 
  2. Make the main React root container also take up the full height and
     act as a flexible column for its children (Navbar, main content).
*/
#root {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;

/* 
  3. Target the <main> element within our App.jsx to make it the scrollable area.
     This is the most important part for usability.
*/

  flex-grow: 1; /* This makes the <main> element expand to fill all available vertical space between the Navbar and the bottom of the screen. */
  
  overflow-y: auto; /* This says: "If the content inside me is too tall, show a scrollbar ONLY for me, not the whole page." */
  
  /* We add padding here to ensure content doesn't touch the edges */
